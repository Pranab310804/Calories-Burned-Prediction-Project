# Calories-Burned Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict the number of calories burned based on exercise and physiological data.

## Overview

The goal is to create a predictive model that estimates calories burned during exercise using datasets like `exercise.csv` and `calories.csv`. 
The model is trained using various features such as age, duration, heart rate, and more.

## Files

- `Calorie_burned_project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing data analysis and model training.
- `calories.csv`: Dataset containing calorie values for different individuals.
- `exercise.csv`: Dataset containing exercise details and physiological parameters.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
